Throughout this SQL project I aimed to show my skills by breaking down data found on Kaggle on the topic of AppleStore App Ratings. When I first discovered this dataframe, I wondered to myself what type of implementation does analyzing this dataframe have on real life businesses or startups looking to create a app and arent well informed on what prime genre areas may be in order to jump into the business. Through the use of SQL, I was able to break the dataframe down and answer the following questions:
1. Do paid apps have better ratings?
2. Do apps supporting more languages have better ratings?
3. Which genres have the lowest rating?
4. Does description length under apps affect their ratings?
5. What rating should a new app aim for?

Through analyzing the data using SQL, I was able to find that:
1. Paid apps have better ratings
2. Apps that support bebtween 10-30 languages have better ratings
3. Finance and Book apps have the lowest ratings
4. Apps with longer descriptions have better ratings
5. New apps should aim for an average rating above 3.5
